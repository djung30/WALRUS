**2048:** Our final project is a terminal recreation of the iconic game 2048, which was originally created by Gabriele Cirulli on the 9th of March, 2014. The objective of the game will be to add blocks with values that are exponents of 2 until the user reaches the 2048 block. 

# How To Play
- Open terminal, compile and run Woo.java.
- Use your WASD to shift the tiles.
- Tiles with the same number merge into one when they touch. 
- Add them up to reach 2048!
